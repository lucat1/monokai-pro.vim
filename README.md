<h2 align="center">The Story</h2>

After using and admiring the [Monokai Pro](https://monokai.pro/) Colorscheme for so long, I wanted to port it to my favorite editor, thus I created this colorscheme for peasants like me and you. We can finally enjoy and experience a premium, and truly professional, programming experience with this beautifully designed masterpiece of a palette.
